# AWS VPC


## AWS VPC Security

- In a VPC, both Security Groups and Network ACLs together help to build a layered network defence.
- __Security groups__ - Act as a virtual firewall for associated instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level
- __NACL__ - Act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level
