Just passed my AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional exam!

Some tips from my experience:

1 You need to prepare for this, do not expect to wing it and pass. I used aCloudGuru and failed their practice exam yesterday which changed my test taking strategy. Their content is solid, and the section quizzes can point you to where you need to focus.

2 Don't blast through questions assuming the right answer will pop out at you. I answered at least 75% of the questions based on elimination because it was usually one tiny detail that was the difference. This was the difference in my strategy from when I tried the ACG practice exam.

3 Write down the details as you are reading the question and then possible choices (multiple choice, pick 2/5 or 3/6 type answers). Then work through each answer eliminating as you go. I don't see how you could keep everything in your head and not miss something on these questions.

4 Pace yourself. It is 75 questions over 180 minutes, and I used all but 4 minutes. Flag questions to come back to if you aren't comfortable with your answer, but do not dwell. I think I marked 8 for follow-up and changed 2 answers based on details I was able to glean from other questions.

5 RedBull gives you wings!
